# Teleboxel

_Aims to be_ the fastest Boxel websocket server in Rust (Tokio) to create Minecraft-like multiplayer games.

Work in progress!

## Goals

-   The fastest way to sync voxels and player positions with WebSockets
-   Simple handcrafted protocol
-   Just vital dependencies (Tokio, Axum, fastwebsockets)
